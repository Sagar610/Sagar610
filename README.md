## About

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with experience working in high-scale production environments (including Meta projects). I care about building software that stays reliable under real usage: correct data handling, clear audit trails, and operational safety (monitoring, backups, recovery).

Alongside professional roles, I build independent products end-to-end — from problem discovery and architecture to shipping and maintenance — usually based on real workflows and direct user feedback.
