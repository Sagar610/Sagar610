## 👨‍💻 Professional Summary

I am a Senior Software Engineer with experience working in high-scale production environments, including my role at Meta. My background spans full-stack engineering, data-driven systems, and applied machine learning, with a strong focus on building reliable, user-centric software products.

In parallel with my professional roles, I independently design, build, and deploy end-to-end applications that solve real business problems. My work demonstrates ownership across the full product lifecycle — from problem definition and system architecture to deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

I am currently based in London, UK, and focused on contributing to the UK digital technology ecosystem through innovation, product development, and knowledge sharing.

## 🚀 Featured Product: Retail POS System (Production)

**Custom Point-of-Sale (POS) system for small retail businesses**

- Designed and built end-to-end by me as an independent product
- Developed to address billing, inventory tracking, and operational inefficiencies in small retail environments
- Currently **used by 3 independent retail shops in the UK**
- Deployed as a live production system with active daily usage
- Ongoing maintenance and feature improvements based on direct user feedback

### Key Capabilities
- Sales and billing workflows
- Inventory tracking and reporting
- Transaction history and basic analytics
- Offline-tolerant frontend design
- Secure backend APIs and data storage

**Development note:**  
The system was initially developed privately and later open-sourced once it reached a stable, production-ready stage.
